# Setting up colors
#
# Note, standard matplotlib color list is at
# https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html
# 
# But I'm specifying colors that make up a color-blind friendly palette
# using Paul Tol's "Vibrant scheme" 
# https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative 

# I chose to give them each a number name as
# well as a title to make it easier to use
# the order of the colors corresponds to my
# preferred ordering :-)

one = vsBlue = "#0077BB"

five = vsTeal = "#009988"
six = vsOrange = "#EE7733"
